# CLIS GLA 2

This Github repositorary contains my solutions to the second graded lab
assignment of the Command Line Interfaces and Scripting (CLIS) course.

Each numbered directory contains solutions to one question, with all
relevant files and screenshots, and an `Answer.md` file, which contains
explanations and comments.
